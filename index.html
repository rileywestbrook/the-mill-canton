            <p id="formerly">
              Formerly known as Mill #1, the factory was built in 1900 and actively produced denim until 1981.
              Mill #1 along with it’s sister factory, Mill #2 (collectively Canton Cotton Mills) are a vital part of
              the history of Canton and were the main source of employment for the residents. The factories produced
              valuable denim cloth that was known for it’s durability. They consistently improved manufacturing to create
              a top of the line product that was used in World War II. Production began to decrease in the 1970’s and eventually
              the Canton Cotton Mills were closed in 1981.

            <p id="mill-1">
              Mill #1 was founded and financed by Robert Tyre Jones and his family re-purposed the building to serve as warehouse
              and production space for local tenants for the next three decades. In 2018, the property was purchased by a group of
              local developers with intent to revitalize the structure and honor the history of Canton. The vision is to activate the
              riverfront with signature restaurants, unique retail spaces and creative office and event space.
